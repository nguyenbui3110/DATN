1. Create a virtual environment by running the following command:
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment. On Windows, run:
    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    On macOS and Linux, run:
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using pip. Run the following command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. After the installation is complete, you can start your Flask server by running the following command:
    ```
    flask run
    ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see your Flask application in action.

Remember to update the `requirements.txt` file with any additional dependencies your project requires.
